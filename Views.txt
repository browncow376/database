
For your database, propose at least two interesting views that can be built from your relations.  
These views must involve joining at least two tables together each and must include some kind of 
aggregation in the view.
Each view must also be able to be described by a one or two sentence description in plain English.  
Provide the code for constructing your views along with the English language description of what the view is supposed to be providing. 
Name the txt file “Views.txt”.



CREATE VIEW NUM_OF_CHECKOUTS
AS	SELECT LibraryCard.LibraryCardNbr, COUNT(*)
	FROM LibraryCard, Checkouts
	WHERE LibraryCard.LibraryCardNbr = Checkouts.LibraryCardNbr AND LibraryCard.IsActive = TRUE
	GROUP BY LibraryCard.Nbr

This will create a view for number of checkouts that each active library card has. 



CREATE VIEW NUM_OF_MOVIES
AS	SELECT ActorName, MAX(ReleaseDate), Count(*) 
	FROM Actor, Movie
	WHERE Actor.MovieApeearance = Movie.MovieName
	GROUP BY ActorName

This will determine the number of movies a actor has been in and display their most recent movie release date.
